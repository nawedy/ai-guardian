### ðŸ“Š Test Data

#### User Feedback Test
```json
{
  "user_id": "test_user_001",
  "vulnerability_id": "PY003_8828b95d",
  "feedback": "false_positive",
  "context": {
    "type": "HARDCODED_SECRET",
    "severity": "CRITICAL"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "HARDCODED_SECRET": 0.86,  // Reduced from 0.9 due to false positive
    "SQL_INJECTION": 0.8,
    "XSS": 0.8,
    "CODE_INJECTION": 0.9,
    "CSRF": 0.7
  },
  "preference_weights": {
    "HARDCODED_SECRET": -0.2  // Negative weight indicates false positive tendency
  }
}
```
