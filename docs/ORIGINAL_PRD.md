3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Continuous Monitoring
Objective: Scan every line of code in real-time as developers write or modify it, both in OmnipanelAI and standalone environments.Features:  

Real-Time Scanning:  
In OmnipanelAI: Scan code in the web-based IDE within 500ms of typing or saving.  
Standalone: Scan code changes in IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm) within 500ms.  
Supported languages: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Rust (add TypeScript, Ruby by Q1 2027).  
Detect vulnerabilities from OWASP Top 10 (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF) and CWE/SANS Top 25.  
Identify privacy violations (e.g., hardcoded API keys, PII exposure).


Background Scanning:  
Run full-project scans every 10 minutes or on file save (configurable).  
Cache results to avoid redundant scans (use file hashes to detect changes).  
Notify users via OmnipanelAI’s notification panel or IDE gutter icons.


Offline Mode (Standalone Only):  
Cache vulnerability signatures locally for offline scanning (sync updates weekly).  
Limit offline remediation to known patterns (full remediation requires internet).



Technical Details:  

Use Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for language-specific analysis.  
Integrate with open-source scanners (e.g., Bandit for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).  
Store scan results in SQLite for local caching (standalone), sync to cloud (MongoDB) for OmnipanelAI and premium standalone users.  
Implement WebSocket for real-time communication between OmnipanelAI/IDE and cloud.  
For OmnipanelAI: Leverage its WebAssembly-based runtime to run scans in-browser.

User Stories:  

As a developer using OmnipanelAI, I want real-time alerts in the web IDE, so I can fix issues seamlessly.  
As a standalone user, I want IDE-integrated scans to catch vulnerabilities as I code.

3.2 Instant Remediation
Objective: Provide one-click, context-aware fixes for detected issues in both OmnipanelAI and standalone modes.Features:  

One-Click Fixes:  
In OmnipanelAI: Show fix suggestions in a side panel with apply button.  
Standalone: Suggest fixes in IDE (e.g., replace eval() with safer alternatives).  
Show diff preview before applying changes.  
Support rollback (undo fix within 30 seconds).


Contextual Suggestions:  
Tailor fixes to project dependencies (e.g., use sanitize-html if installed).  
Avoid suggesting deprecated libraries (check package.json, pom.xml).


Batch Remediation:  
Apply fixes across multiple files (e.g., replace all hardcoded secrets).  
Log changes in OmnipanelAI’s audit log or .guardian-log file (standalone).


Custom Fix Templates:  
Allow premium users to define custom remediation patterns.



Technical Details:  

Use ML models (e.g., CodeBERT) to generate context-aware fixes.  
Train models on GitHub repositories (public, permissive licenses only).  
Validate fixes against test suites (if detected, e.g., Jest, JUnit).  
For OmnipanelAI: Use its API to apply fixes in the web IDE.  
For standalone: Implement a REST API for cloud-based remediation (AWS Lambda).

User Stories:  

As an OmnipanelAI user, I want fixes integrated into my workflow, so I don’t leave the web IDE.  
As a standalone user, I want one-click fixes that don’t break my code.

3.3 Intelligent Analysis
Objective: Understand project structure and business logic for accurate scanning in both environments.Features:  

Project Context Awareness:  
Parse project files (package.json, requirements.txt) to detect frameworks.  
Map file relationships (e.g., controller calls service layer).  
Prioritize critical files (e.g., API endpoints).


Business Logic Detection:  
Identify sensitive functions (e.g., payment processing) using regex and AST.  
Flag logic errors that could lead to vulnerabilities.


Dependency Scanning:  
Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using NVD database (update daily).  
Suggest safe version upgrades.



Technical Details:  

Use graph databases (Neo4j) to model project file relationships.  
Implement static taint analysis for data flows.  
Cache NVD data locally (JSON) for standalone offline checks.  
For OmnipanelAI: Run analysis in cloud (AWS ECS) to leverage its compute resources.

User Stories:  

As an OmnipanelAI user, I want scans tailored to my project’s framework, so alerts are relevant.  
As a standalone user, I want dependency scans in my CI/CD pipeline.

3.4 Learning Protection
Objective: Adapt to user coding patterns and preferences over time.Features:  

Pattern Learning:  
Learn user-specific coding habits (e.g., preferred libraries).  
Adjust false positive thresholds based on feedback.


Preference Customization:  
Suppress rules (e.g., “ignore low-severity XSS in tests”).  
Save preferences in OmnipanelAI’s user profile or .guardian-config.yaml (standalone).


Team Knowledge Sharing:  
Sync learned patterns across team members (premium/enterprise only).  
Anonymize data (e.g., hash variable names).



Technical Details:  

Use reinforcement learning to refine detection models.  
Store preferences in DynamoDB (OmnipanelAI) or YAML (standalone).  
Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 before cloud sync.  
For OmnipanelAI: Integrate with its user management system for preferences.

User Stories:  

As an OmnipanelAI user, I want my preferences saved across sessions.  
As a standalone user, I want the AI to learn my coding style locally.
